Stateful agents maintain conversational history across interactions using session IDs. When no `session_id` is provided in a run request, the ACP server automatically generates one and includes it in the run response. If a `session_id` is supplied as input, that same ID is returned with the run response.

The ACP SDK leverages this concept by maintaining the full conversation history for each `session_id`. This allows agents to access the complete history of interactions within a session, provided that the same `session_id` is used consistently across runs.

### ACP Client Sessions

The ACP SDK provides a convenient way to maintain session state through the `session()` context manager. When using a session, the SDK automatically handles session ID management, ensuring that all runs within the session share the same ID.

This makes it easy to build stateful conversations where agents can reference previous interactions:


```python session.py
async with Client(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as client, client.session() as session:
    # First interaction
    run = await session.run_sync(agent="echo", input=[Message(parts=[MessagePart(content="Hello, my name is Joseph!")])])
    # Second interaction in same session
    run = await session.run_sync(agent="echo", input=[Message(parts=[MessagePart(content="What is my name?")])])
```

### ACP Server sessions

When building ACP agent, the `input` argument will contain the full session history from all the previous runs in the same session. `context.session_id` holds the session id, allowing agents to store additional session-related data.

```python stateful_agent.py
@server.agent()
async def stateful_agent(input: list[Message], context: Context) -> AsyncGenerator[RunYield, RunYieldResume]:
    ... # `input` has the full history, `context.session_id` can be used to reference extra data
```
