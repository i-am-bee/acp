title: "Agent Detail"
description: "Structure and usage of the Agent Detail"
openapi-schema: "Agent"
---

The **Agent Detail** describes essential properties of an agent, including its identity, capabilities, metadata, and runtime status. The Agent Detail is configured in the @server.agent decorator that wraps the ACP agent. The Agent Detail also plays an important role in discoverability and how the ACP server is advertised to the client.
<Note>
If the `name` parameter is not specified in the `@server.agent` decorator, the agent's function name will be used as the default name. Similarly, if no `description` is provided, the function's docstring will be used as the description.
</Note>

## Configuration Example
The @server.agent decorator is used to configure an agent's metadata when registering it with an ACP server:
```python agent.py
@server.agent(
    name="data-analyzer",
    description="Analyzes datasets and generates insights")
async def DataAnalyzerAgent():
    """String that is used as default description if not explicitly provided in the @server.agent """
    # Agent implementation here
    yield str(response.object)

```
