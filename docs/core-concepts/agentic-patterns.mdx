title: Agentic Patterns
description: "Learn how ACP defines standardized message schemas for common Agentic Patterns"
---

Agentic patterns are common, well-established approaches for agentic systems, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, RAG agents with citations, and other structures. These patterns provide transparency into agent decision-making, thought processes, tool usage, information sources, and many more.

ACP leverages the `metadata` field in `MessagePart` to convey agentic patterns within the actual conversation history.

While this metadata is not part of the main conversation flow, it can be utilized by third-party systems, user interfaces, debugging tools, and other applications to enhance understanding, monitoring, and interaction with the agent.

A great example of the value of standardized agentic patterns is the [BeeAI platform](https://beeai.dev), which exposes certain agentic patterns through a clean, intuitive GUI.

## Overview

While standard message parts focus on content delivery, agentic pattern message parts add semantic meaning through metadata that can describe certain agentic patterns like reasoning, actions, and information sources.

ACP defines a `kind` field within metadata to standardize well-established agentic patterns. The `kind` field serves as a semantic identifier that categorizes the type of agentic pattern being represented.

## Common Agentic Patterns

ACP defines opinions on several common, well-established agentic patterns. It specifies the recognized `kind` for each pattern, along with the corresponding payloads.

### Citations & Sources

Citations enable agents to attribute specific parts of their generated content to original sources, making them essential for research agents and RAG agents that need to provide verifiable references.

An agent can generate citations by utilizing `CitationMetadata`, either through the SDK or by including it directly as a JSON message part.

```python Python
