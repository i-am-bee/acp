# ACP - What's New

## Major updates

1. ~~Pre-Alpha~~ -> **v0.1.0** ([OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/blob/main/docs/spec/openapi.yaml))
1. ~~MCP + JSON-RPC~~ -> **ACP + REST**
1. üêç New Python SDK: **`acp-sdk v0.9.1`**
1. üìö New documentation site: https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev

---

## Why REST instead of MCP + JSON-RPC?

MCP was designed to connect context to models. ACP was designed to connect agents to agents, with the following in mind:

1. **Ease of use and integration** (REST is the web standard; no SDK required)
1. Agent-to-agent requires an opinion on **message structure** (what travels on the wire).
1. Full support for **partial result streaming**.
1. In-built support for **shared memory/state**.
1. Designed for **long-running async requests**.

But since there are a lot of MCP clients out there, we built an [ACP-MCP adapter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp-mcp)!

---

## üè≠ Core Concepts

ACP is about **agents** communicating with **messages**. **Run** is an agent in execution, invoked by a **server** upon **client**'s request.

```python
# server.py
@server.agent(name="echo_bot")
async def echo(input: list[Message]):
    """Echoes everything"""
    for message in input:
        yield message

# client.py
async with Client(base_url="http://acpserver") as client:
  run = await client.run_sync("Hello!", agent="echo_bot")
  for message in run.output:
    print(message)
```

### Discovery (Agents)
  - Agent Manifest
     - Name, description, etc. 
     - Static description of an agent
  - Built into ACP
     - Served over ACP protocol
  - Registry

### Execution (Runs)
  - An agent in execution
  - Takes input, returns output
  - Streams events
  - Asynchronous in nature
  - Viewed as a coroutine (more in next slide)

---

## üè≠ Core Concepts

### Messages (Format)
  - Runs operate with a sequences of messages
  - Each message is a sequence of parts
  - Each part has a type and content
    - Content might be just a reference (URL)
  - Parts are ideal for streaming

```python
Message(
  parts=[
    MessagePart(content_type="text/plain", content="Hello, do you know this cat?"),
    MessagePart(content_type="image/png", content_url="http://catimages/cat.png"),
  ]
)
```

---

## üöÄ Advanced Concepts

### Awaits

Agents can pause and **await** additional data during a run.

```python
# server.py
@server.agent()
async def config_bot(input: list[Message]) -> AsyncGenerator[RunYield, RunYieldResume]:
    """Requests additional configuration and quits"""
    resume_data = yield MessageAwaitRequest(
        message=Message(
            parts=[
                MessagePart(content="Can you provide me with additional configuration?")
            ]
        )
    )
    yield f"Thanks for {resume_data.message}, bye"

# client.py
async with Client(base_url="http://acpserver") as client:
    run = await client.run_sync("Howdy, my name is Tom!", agent="config_bot")
    if run.await_request:
        run = await client.run_resume_sync(
            MessageAwaitResume(
                message=Message(
                    parts=[MessagePart(content="The password is: password")]
                )
            ),
            run_id=run.run_id,
        )
    for message in run.output:
        print(message)
```

---

## üöÄ Advanced Concepts

### Sessions

Multiple runs can be executed in a **session**.

```python
# client.py
async with Client(base_url="http://acpserver") as client, client.session() as session:
  run = await session.run_sync("Howdy, my name is Tom!", agent="chat_bot")
  for message in run.output:
    print(message)
  run = await session.run_sync("What's my name again?", agent="same_or_another_chat_bot")
  for message in run.output:
    print(message)
```

- Under active development (distributed sessions)
